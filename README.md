# Welcome to the Detector System
This is a GUI aimed at detecting and cropping region of interest (ROI) for any kind of application field. The goal of this GUI is to make detection and training of specific blood cells easier for the user/doctor in order to categorize images captured. Those images will then be passed to the database manager system where will be analyzed and stored.

**ABSTRACT - BIOMEDICAL APPLICATION**
This software that can be used for identification and extraction of region of interests (ROI) for any kind of application. However it is specifically designed to be part of a biomedical visualization pipeline for cancer detection and identification and will complement the Particle Filter Detector System (PFDS). This software will be used for identifying possible carcinogenic formation, categorize them and store them into a database system for quick image recognition. This software can be used for future training of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network).
Image  below shows how after selecting a search interval of the chosen feature of interest, the mean squared error (MSE) is minimal in only one point in the graph showin perfect correspondence on image B. This algorithm has been tested many times and with many different images and everytime the related feature of interest could be found on image B.

Additional possibilities in this GUI are capturing and extracting the proper and chosen area. A dialog will appear after the selection asking the user/doctor to input specific information about the blood sample provided. Measuring capabilities between selected points are also provided via triangulation. A databse of information ius created and passed to the database management system, described in its poroper report and anciallry system to the Particle Filter Detector System (PFDS).

Features under development:
1. Area analysis combobox
2. Bookmarked region for future reference
3. Adding database features
4. Making the process automatic with single button click
